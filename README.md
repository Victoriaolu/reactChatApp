Key Components
Frontend (React)
Components: Create reusable components such as ChatWindow, Message, UserList, and RoomList.
Pages: Implement pages like ChatRoom where users can join specific rooms.
Context API: Use React's Context API to manage global state, including user authentication and chat history.
WebSocket Connection: Establish a WebSocket connection to the backend for real-time messaging.
Backend (Node.js)
Controllers: Handle requests related to user authentication, message sending, and retrieving chat history.
Models: Define data models for users and messages using a database (e.g., MongoDB).
Routes: Set up Express routes for RESTful APIs and WebSocket connections.
WebSocket Management: Implement logic to manage WebSocket connections, broadcasting messages to users in the same room.
Milestones Implementation
Implement Authentication:
Use JWT for user authentication.
Create login and registration endpoints in the backend.
Store User Chat History:
Save messages in a database associated with user IDs and room IDs.
Provide an endpoint to retrieve chat history when a user joins a room.
Make Application Responsive:
Utilize CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or styled-components to ensure the UI is responsive across devices.
Bonus Features:
Allow users to upload profile pictures and add bios by extending user models and creating corresponding frontend forms.
Implement functionality to view other users' bios within chat rooms by fetching user data from the backend.
This project structure provides a solid foundation for developing your chat application while ensuring scalability and maintainability as you add more features.
HOW TO CLONE THE PROJECT IN LOCAL MACHINE
To clone your chat application project using Git, follow these steps in your terminal:
Open your terminal: You can use any terminal application such as Command Prompt, PowerShell, Terminal (macOS), or any Linux terminal.
Navigate to the directory: Change to the directory where you want to clone the project. For example:
bash
cd /path/to/your/directory

Clone the repository: Use the git clone command followed by the repository URL. If your chat application is hosted on GitHub, the command will look like this:
bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git

Replace YOUR_USERNAME and YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME with your actual GitHub username and the name of your repository.
Navigate into the cloned directory: After cloning, change into the project directory:
bash
cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME

Install dependencies: If your project uses Node.js, you may need to install the necessary packages. Run:
bash
npm install

Start the application: Depending on how your application is set up, you might start it with:
bash
npm start

or for a backend server, you might run:
bash
node server.js

Access the application: Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:3000 (or whichever port your application is configured to use) to see your chat application in action.
By following these steps, you can successfully clone and run your chat application project in your terminal.

Project Description
Overview
The chat application is designed to facilitate seamless communication between users in real-time through a web-based interface. Utilizing modern web technologies such as React for the frontend and Node.js with WebSocket for the backend, the application supports various functionalities including text messaging, multimedia sharing, and user authentication.
Objectives
The primary objectives of the chat application include:
Real-time Messaging: Enable users to send and receive messages instantly using WebSocket technology.
User Authentication: Implement secure login and registration processes to ensure user identity verification and data protection.
Chat History Storage: Allow users to access their previous conversations by storing chat histories in a database.
Responsive Design: Ensure the application is accessible on various devices, providing a consistent user experience.
Key Features
Real-time Communication: Users can engage in one-on-one or group chats with immediate message delivery.
Multimedia Support: Users can share images, videos, documents, and links during chats, enhancing interaction.
User Profiles: Each user can create a profile with customizable settings, including profile pictures and bios.
Room Management: Users can join different chat rooms, facilitating organized discussions around specific topics.
Typing Indicators: The application provides visual cues when users are typing, improving conversational flow.
Search Functionality: Users can easily search through past messages and media shared in conversations.
Technical Stack
Frontend: Built using React.js, which allows for a dynamic and responsive user interface.
Backend: Developed with Node.js, providing a scalable server environment that handles WebSocket connections for real-time communication.
Database: MongoDB or similar databases are used to store user data and chat histories securely.
Milestones
Implement Authentication: Develop secure login and registration functionalities using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
Store User Chat History: Create backend endpoints to save and retrieve chat messages associated with user accounts.
Make Application Responsive: Utilize CSS frameworks or media queries to ensure the application is mobile-friendly.
Bonus Features:
Allow users to upload profile pictures and add bios to their profiles.
Enable users to view bios of other users within the same chat rooms.
